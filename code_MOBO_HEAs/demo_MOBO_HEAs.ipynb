Introduction\n","- This notebook provides instructions on the source code of our paper titled \"Discovering High Entropy Alloy Electrocatalysts in Vast Composition Spaces with Multi-objective Optimization\". It covers various aspects including installation, usage, and examples, which enable the reproduction of the results presented in the paper.\n","- The key components of the source code include the multi-objective optimization (located in the 'MOBO' directory) and the Graph Neural Networks model (found in the 'GNN' directory)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"14e33c48-9335-41f2-9f80-ccbe4091bdd5","metadata":{"id":"14e33c48-9335-41f2-9f80-ccbe4091bdd5"},"source":["# 2. Installation\n","The easiest way to install the prerequisites is via [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html). All the dependencies are given in `env.yml`.

Usage\n","We provide three optimization tasks as showcases in compliance with our manuscript, that are:\n","1. bi-objective optimization for 5-element AgIrPdPtRu HEA space on activity and cost.\n","3. bi-objective optimization for 10-element AgAuCuIrOsPdPtReRhRu space on activity and ideal mixing entropy.\n","4. tri-objective optimization for 5-element AgIrPdPtRu HEA space on activity, cost and ideal mixing entropy.\n","   \n","Please checkout submission script at \"MOBO/run_script/run_bash.sh\" and these predefined taskes at \"MOBO/autooed/problem/custom/python/heas.py\"\n","\n","To run the script from the command line, navigate to the /MOBO/run_script directory and execute the following command:\n","```bash\n","python run_seeds.py --problem HEAS_AgIrPdPtRu --algo custom  --batch-size 4 --n-total-sample 100 --n-init-sample 10 --n_seed 5 --subfolder agirpdptru_i10b4_rbf\n","```\n","This will execute the first task five times with different seeds, where the batch size, the total number of samples, and the number of initial samples are set to 4, 100, and 10, respectively. The results will be stored in the /MOBO/result directory.
